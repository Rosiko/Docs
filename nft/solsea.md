# SolSea

We are a group of friends, technology enthusiasts working together to create a new ecosystem on the blockchain.&#x20;

We have developed our Token (RSK) on Solana network of course and we are implementing the website (<mark style="background-color:blue;">**https://rosikocoin.site/**</mark>).&#x20;

The site will have the swapper (currently the token swap is only possible on Raydium) and there will be a "betting" section through the token itself.

Finally, there will be the possibility to buy our NFTs through our site.&#x20;

We are not developers, and we are not as performing as some companies, but we will arrive at our goal.&#x20;

Our Token was born as a game, we want it to be used to play on our site (under construction) and to be used among friends for small playful bets.&#x20;

We are self-financing and, having an inordinate passion for technology, we are obviously interested in AI.\
Who wouldn't want to try to generate "works of art" with their AI. \
Well we are trying and we would like to see what the world thinks about it. \
<mark style="color:blue;">The earnings will be reused to finance the project</mark>, helping us to accelerate the conclusion of the site <mark style="color:red;">and to forge any partnerships with some real artists</mark>, so as to give the less experienced the opportunity to make themselves known in the NFT world.
