# Tokenomics (Beta Version 2.01)

## CONTRACT

CONTRACT: Ckz7u6p9L5DD1Qf162ChMoCNfJKphEBnMYdc8jmxxWG5

Link [https://solana.fm/address/Ckz7u6p9L5DD1Qf162ChMoCNfJKphEBnMYdc8jmxxWG5?cluster=mainnet-alpha](https://solana.fm/address/Ckz7u6p9L5DD1Qf162ChMoCNfJKphEBnMYdc8jmxxWG5?cluster=mainnet-alpha)\
\
**Current Supply** = 249.995.838 RSK

**Actual Token Hold from Wallet Creator**= 164.889.357,118580483 RSK



## GAME

As passionate as we are, we cannot write all the code and follow all the phases of the project, including application development.

We are therefore evaluating a few different suppliers for the development of the video game. We are evaluating capacity and reliability.

Surely we will still have a role in reviewing the development at key points, ensuring the community that we can release a properly functioning product.

For the moment, however, we have created the address that will manage in-game transactions in a dedicated way.

38,000,000 RSK have been allocated (15% of the entire Supply)\
This is the address that will be used:

* [J1aPr6bn9PSJsRjnSniwrn8Cyub8gVGNZaUjGsYdS7Gt](https://solscan.io/account/J1aPr6bn9PSJsRjnSniwrn8Cyub8gVGNZaUjGsYdS7Gt) (30.000.000 RSK allocated)\
  **NOTE**: _The Wallet is_ [HK5792kDm56BUE2u5p8FM3JBwFzmfRJmbRt385xMSbNf](https://solana.fm/address/HK5792kDm56BUE2u5p8FM3JBwFzmfRJmbRt385xMSbNf/tokens?cluster=mainnet-alpha)

A part of the tokens owned by the Authority address will probably be added later, leading the address to hold 35%-40% of the total supply

At this moment this wallet is the second holder immediately after the creator wallet

Since the project is still in the development phase, the creator still owns the largest number of Tokens, but it is expected that during the development of smart contracts, the game and also creating new LiquidityPools on DEX and CEX, the creator wallet should give up the majority of tokens.

Below we detail some steps that will help with this change

## NFT & SmartContract

See [Roadmap](../roadmap/) section to find out when it will be ready, for now we go ahead by self-financing.

We have decided that for the management of smart contracts, we will rely on NFTs.&#x20;

We will undoubtedly create two collections with unique NFTs.

### DEVS Collection

The first collection will be promptly donated (via private transactions) to the developers.&#x20;

Naturally, both the NFTs and the transactions will be documented for full transparency.&#x20;

This will allow us to automate a 'payment' to those who actively supported the project by helping us develop it from the idea to the code.&#x20;

The number of these NFTs will be limited to 10-20 NFTs (still under discussion).



### The most significant supporters

The second collection will be listed for sale on our NFT Market.&#x20;

Again, we will communicate everything to ensure transparency in our operations.&#x20;

By purchasing NFTs from this collection, you will be entitled to an RSK 'airdrop' (likely monthly and lasting a maximum of 10 years â€“ discussion in progress) as a reward for your purchase.&#x20;

Payment will continue through the NFT even if transferred to another wallet; however, it will be executed for the new owner of the NFT.&#x20;

We are also considering whether to provide, through this NFT, a 'gaming-related benefit' associated with the game that will be developed in the future.

**Please note that we have planned a collection on SolSea to help finance the project, but it will not be subject to this treatment**.



### Our biggest fans

We are considering creating a drop edition with a high number of 'identical' NFTs, each associated with a third smart contract.&#x20;

Currently, there is a discussion about whether the reward should be in RSK (similar to the second collection, although the airdrop amount will naturally be lower) or if we should consider a 'gaming-related benefit' associated with a game that will be developed in the future.&#x20;

This edition will be available until exhausted, providing an opportunity for anyone to mint their NFT with benefits\
