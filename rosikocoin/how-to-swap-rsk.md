# ‚ùî How to Swap RSK

{% hint style="info" %}
**Good to know:**&#x20;

In order to carry out the procedure described, it is necessary to have a Wallet on the Solana network and to use a Browser extension for your Wallet (e.g. PhantomWallet or Solflare)&#x20;

Furthermore, since the commissions must be paid in SOL, it will be necessary to have some SOL available in the Wallet
{% endhint %}

## How to:

## Access to the market

To execute the swap you need to access the Market. Since it is not present on centralized exchanges, it is necessary to access an automated market maker (AMM)

{% hint style="info" %}
**I'm a beginner:**

If you want to better understand what an AMM Market is, we suggest this link

[https://chain.link/education-hub/what-is-an-automated-market-maker-amm#:\~:text=Automated%20market%20makers%20(AMMs)%20are%20a%20type%20of%20decentralized%20exchange,trade%20directly%20through%20the%20AMM.](https://chain.link/education-hub/what-is-an-automated-market-maker-amm)
{% endhint %}

### From Website

By simply using the link available on our site, it will be possible to directly access the Market by clicking on SWAP

It will then land on the Market Raydium. On first use you will be asked to accept the banner associated with the use of the OpenSource interface

Once you accept the banner, you will be taken directly to the swap interface with the default pair

### Directly

It is possible to access the market directly, without having to go to the website. To do this, simply access Raydium and click on the "Launch App" item at the top right.

The application will start and it will then be possible to choose any Token (listed on the market) to swap with RSK

{% hint style="info" %}
**Good to know:**&#x20;

In case the USDC/RSK pair is not used, the swap will take place anyway, but since the direct route for each token is not yet present, the market will switch first to USDC and then to RSK

This will result in a slightly higher fee, based on the selected token

Example:

{% endhint %}

## Connect your wallet to the Market

It will therefore be necessary to connect the wallet via the right extension.

Below you will find the two most used wallets on the Solana network.

The procedure will be very similar with other Wallets as well.

This section will be updated in the future with new extensions available, based on community requests

### Phantom Wallet

If you have a solana wallet, but don't know how to import it to the Phantom extension, we recommend reading this guide:

{% embed url="https://help.phantom.app/hc/en-us/articles/4406527601811-How-to-migrate-from-Sollet" %}

If you don't have a wallet, we suggest you to follow the guide below in order to correctly create a wallet directly from Phantom

{% embed url="https://help.phantom.app/hc/en-us/articles/8071074929043-How-to-create-a-new-wallet" %}

At this point you will have your wallet ready to be connected with the AMM Market.\
Click "Connect Wallet" and choose your extension from the list, in this case Phantom.

The browser extension will then open asking you to enter your login password. You will also be prompted to confirm connection to the AMM

Now that you're connected, just fill in how many USDC you want to swap or alternatively, how many RSK you want.&#x20;

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (11).png>)

By clicking on "SWAP" at the bottom of the interface, confirmation of the transaction via the extension will be requested again, and the transaction costs will also be indicated (generally 0.000005 - 0.00005 SOL). \
By confirming, the transaction will be started and a few seconds later (the Solana network is performing) you will find your RSK on your Wallet

### Solflare Wallet
