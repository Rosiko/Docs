# ☑️ About RosikoCoin

## Excited intro

We’re a group of friends and tech enthusiasts who decided to create our own token—a social token that makes exchanging value easy, quick, and fun.

When we first asked ourselves how a social token should be used, we realized it could be perfect for friendly betting and playful challenges.



> <mark style="color:green;">Tomas</mark>: "Hey man, let's bet 25 RSK that you won't be able to eat 2 burgers..."\
> <mark style="color:orange;">Johnny</mark>: "Hell yes!" :joy:

> <mark style="color:purple;">Rob</mark>: "Hey, we’re playing poker tonight—are you in?"\
> <mark style="color:red;">Pier</mark>: "Count me in! Using RSK again?" \
> <mark style="color:purple;">Rob</mark>: "Of course! We're all putting 500 RSK in."&#x20;

> <mark style="color:yellow;">Erick</mark>:  "Check out this awesome NFT."\
> <mark style="color:blue;">Grace</mark>: "Bro, how much was it?"\
> <mark style="color:yellow;">Erick</mark>: "Only 1500 RSK!"

To make all this happen, we chose Solana for its high performance and ultra-low fees.

Got a Solana wallet? Just head over to our site, click "Swapper," and make a transaction.&#x20;

## Okay, now seriously!

On a serious note, we are building this project using our own resources, creativity, and ideas. We won’t perform like those massive projects backed by huge capital, but we’ll follow through with our mission.

In a world as complex as blockchain and crypto, transparency is key. That’s why we’ve decided to document every stage of development (Alpha, Beta, V1.00, etc.) so you can track our progress. Expect improvements, additions, and maybe the occasional one-sided decision—anything that keeps the project alive and evolving.

We also want to give the token real utility and a sense of reliability:

* Use RSK to buy NFTs on our RskSea marketplace.
* Expect token burns, as well as farming and staking options, allowing successful bettors to grow their token holdings over time.
* Enjoy the possibility of NFT airdrops for those who hold a certain number of tokens. Some NFTs might unlock further RSK airdrops, or gain value on our marketplace if someone finds them irresistible.

To make communication more interactive and responsive, we’re integrating AI support. Our AI Assistant will provide immediate help to users in our official channels (like Telegram and Discord), offering quick answers to questions about documentation or general doubts about the project. This brings more convenience, interactivity, and lays the groundwork for future AI-driven features in the ecosystem.
