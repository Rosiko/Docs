# ☑️ About RosikoCoin

## Excited intro

We are a group of friends, tech junkies, who have decided to create their own token. A social token, that allow us to exchange currency easily, quickly and can be fun to use.

Once we discussed what the right uses of a social token should be, we understood that it could also become an excellent token for betting.

> <mark style="color:green;">Tomas</mark>: "Hey man, let's bet 25 RSK that you won't be able to eat 2 burgers..."\
> <mark style="color:orange;">Johnny</mark>: "Hell yes!" :joy:\

> <mark style="color:purple;">Rob</mark>: "Hey man, we'd like to play poker with the boys tonight. Are you in?"\
> <mark style="color:red;">Pier</mark>: "Dude, I'd love to... always with RSK?" \
> <mark style="color:purple;">Rob</mark>: "Sure! We all go in with 500 RSK"&#x20;

> <mark style="color:yellow;">Erick</mark>: "Hey look at this awesome NFT"\
> <mark style="color:blue;">Grace</mark>: "Bro, How much did you pay for it? \
> <mark style="color:yellow;">Erick</mark>: "Only 1500 RSK"

We therefore have decide to rely on a performing network with extremely low fees: Solana.

Do you have a solana wallet right?! Just go to our site, click on "Swapper" and execute the transaction.

## Okay, now seriously!

We are building the project drawing on our strength, our money and our ideas.

We will not be performing like certain projects with immense capital behind them, but we will carry out our mission.

To be as transparent as possible in a world (like blockchain and crypto) that is difficult to interpret, we have decided to trace the drafts of the documents that will be published (es. Alpha Version, Beta Version, V1.00, ecc). There will be improvements, additions and possibly "one-sided changes" that allows our project to **never** die.

We also want to give some usefulness and a certain seriousness to the project.

The token can be used to purchase our NFTs on our [RskSea ](nft/rsksea.md)market

We are also planning some Burns and we are studying on how to implement Farm & Stakes, allowing RSK winners to increase their token count.

Play a little, win, stake, increase your capital and tomorrow you are ready to start betting with friends again.&#x20;

There will be NFT airdrops for those with a certain number of tokens, and who knows maybe putting it for sale on our Market, some jealous could make you an interesting offer ... but hey attention! We look far, some NFT might entitle you to some RSK airdrop.

We are paving the way for a new way to play online and in real life.
